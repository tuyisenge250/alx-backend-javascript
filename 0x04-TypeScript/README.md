TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript developed and maintained by Microsoft, designed to enhance the development experience by adding static type definitions. This allows developers to catch errors early through compile-time checks, improve code quality and maintainability, and leverage modern JavaScript features before they are widely supported by browsers. TypeScript code is transpiled to plain JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with any environment that runs JavaScript, making it a powerful tool for building large-scale applications with improved tooling and development workflows.
